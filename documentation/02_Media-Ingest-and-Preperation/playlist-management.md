## Introduction to Playlist Management  

Playlists are a useful tool in a variety of different scenarios:
* String a number of entries together, to playback one after the other
* Use playlists to power sections of application UI, with content lists being easy to order or even be automatically created.

Kaltura supports two different types of playlists:
* Manual Playlists: content is manually added and sorted
* Rule-Based / Conditional Playlists: content is added based on a set of filters, and is sorted based on selected criteria

To get an idea of how playlists are configured and used:

### QuickStart  
Kaltura playlists can be added, updated, deleted and listed via the [`playlist service`](https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/testmeDoc/index.php?service=playlist).
